            </h3>
            <p>I’m a multimedia enthusiast driven by curiosity and a passion for technology. With a background rooted in creative storytelling and visual expression, I’ve gradually expanded my interests to include mobile app development, frontend and backend design, and digital production. I thrive at the intersection of art and tech—whether I’m designing sleek user interfaces, crafting immersive visuals, or experimenting with interactive content. My goal is to become a versatile digital creator who not only builds functional products but also tells meaningful stories through every project. I’m always eager to learn new tools, platforms, and languages, and I see every challenge as a stepping stone toward growth. As technology continues to shape the future, I want to be part of that evolution—creating experiences that are not only innovative but also impactful and human-centered.</p>

                <h4>Mobile App Development</h4>
                <p>As part of my growing journey in tech, I’ve ventured into mobile app development to explore how we can bring ideas to users' fingertips. I develop applications that are not only functional but also visually engaging and user-centered. Using modern development tools and frameworks, I create mobile apps that run smoothly on both Android and iOS platforms. Whether it’s a productivity app, a portfolio viewer, or a creative interactive tool, I aim to blend clean code with intuitive design. Each app I build reflects my goal of using technology to make everyday tasks more efficient and enjoyable.</p>

                <h4>Frontend Development</h4>
                <p>Design and first impressions matter—that’s why I put a lot of focus into frontend development. I craft responsive, visually appealing interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks that bring websites and apps to life. I love turning design concepts into interactive experiences that are both beautiful and functional. As someone rooted in multimedia, I also bring a unique creative edge to each layout, using thoughtful color palettes, smooth transitions, and intuitive user flows. My frontend work isn’t just about looking good—it’s about creating a seamless and meaningful experience for every user.</p>

                <h4>Backend Development</h4>
                <p>Behind every polished app or website is a solid backend, and that’s where I ensure performance, security, and structure come together. I design and implement server-side logic, database management, and APIs that make digital platforms run efficiently. Using tools like PHP, Node.js, MySQL, or Firebase, I work to build reliable foundations that support scalable projects. My approach to backend development is all about problem-solving—figuring out how to turn ideas into functioning systems. It’s like building the unseen engine that powers every digital experience, and it’s a challenge I genuinely enjoy.</p>
